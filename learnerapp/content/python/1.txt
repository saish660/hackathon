~ PYTHON introduction

What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
It is used for:
* web development (server-side),
* software development,
* mathematics,
* system scripting.
Why Python?
* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
* Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

Example 
print("Hello, World!")
