~ Python - String Concatenation
String Concatenation
To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.

Example
Merge variable a with variable b into variable c:

a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + b
print(c)
Example
To add a space between them, add a " ":

a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)

Python - Format - Strings
String Format
As we learned in the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this:

Example
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, I am " + age
print(txt)
But we can combine strings and numbers by using f-strings or the format() method!

F-Strings
F-String was introduced in Python 3.6, and is now the preferred way of formatting strings.

To specify a string as an f-string, simply put an f in front of the string literal, and add curly brackets {} as placeholders for variables and other operations.

Example
Create an f-string:

age = 36
txt = f"My name is John, I am {age}"
print(txt)
Placeholders and Modifiers
A placeholder can contain variables, operations, functions, and modifiers to format the value.

Example
Add a placeholder for the price variable:

price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price} dollars"
print(txt)
A placeholder can include a modifier to format the value.

A modifier is included by adding a colon : followed by a legal formatting type, like .2f which means fixed point number with 2 decimals:

Example
Display the price with 2 decimals:

price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"
print(txt)
A placeholder can contain Python code, like math operations:

Example
Perform a math operation in the placeholder, and return the result:

txt = f"The price is {20 * 59} dollars"
print(txt)
