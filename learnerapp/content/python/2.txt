Execute Python Syntax
As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:

>>> print("Hello, World!")

Hello, World!

Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:
C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
